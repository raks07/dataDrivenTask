# Data Driven Task

## Steps to execute the test suite

### 1. To execute the task install the stable version of node. I have used v14.18.0

### 2. To execute the task run the following command

```bash
node app.js
```

### 3. The output.txt file gets overwritten everytime the program is run

## Assumptions

### 1. The input file's structure remains the same. If the structure changes then I have put a try catch to catch the exception. The rest of the test cases will be executed regardless

### 2. If the data first task does not change, then the whole execution of the test case is terminated

### 3. In the output file I have displayed only the task that was executed
